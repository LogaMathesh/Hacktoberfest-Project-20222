## ðŸ”§ What I Added:
# Python solution for the "Container With Most Water" problem.
#File name: `Container With Most Water.py`
#his script calculates the maximum area of water that can be held between vertical lines using the two-pointer approach.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Used:
# Two-pointer technique to optimize space and time.
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# GitHub username: LogaMathesh
# Aim: Find the maximum area of water container formed between vertical lines
